- Create POC for game & game loop
- - Player Movement
- - Collision Detection
- - Handling
- - Entity (enemies, npcs)
- - Renderer/Window

i: Player File contains data for the other files, including current position. Contains update_position function for player.

i: Movement File handles movement on-screen (and off-screen), to be rendered;
   contains move_left, move_right functions that update position of the thing that moves. Also handles Gravity.

i: Collision File tells the Handling File whether or not the Entity/Player can move to the location requested; basically a database.

i: Handling File contains the main game loop. Processes all rendering on-screen, but does not render. Must know locations of all Entities and Player. Handles all keypresses.

i: Renderer/Window File renders all objects on screen. Only recieves data.

Handling file takes all inputs from files, and sends appropriate outputs.
